#### Week 3
[Week 3: Question 1](https://github.com/Brihadeeshrk/NPTEL-JAVA/blob/master/Week_3/Program3_1.java) For example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,â€¦ is a Fibonacci sequence where 13 is the 8thFibonacci number. A partial code is given and you have to complete the code as per the instruction given as comments.

[Week 3: Question 2](https://github.com/Brihadeeshrk/NPTEL-JAVA/blob/master/Week_3/Program3_2.java) Define a class Point with two fields x and y each of type double. Also , define a method distance(Point p1, Point p2) to calculate the distance between points p1 and p2 and return the value in double. Complete the code segment given below. Use Math.sqrt( ) to calculate the square root.

[Week 3: Question 3](https://github.com/Brihadeeshrk/NPTEL-JAVA/blob/master/Week_3/Program3_3.java) A class Shape is defined with two overloading constructors in it. Another class Test1 is partially defined which inherits the class Shape. The class Test1 should include two overloading constructors as appropriate for some object instantiation shown in main( ) method. You should define the constructors using the super class constructors. Also, override the method calculate( ) in Test1 to calculate the volume of a Shape

[Week 3: Question 4](https://github.com/Brihadeeshrk/NPTEL-JAVA/blob/master/Week_3/Program3_4.java) This program to exercise the call of static and non-static methods. A partial code is given defining two methods, namely sum( ) and multiply ( ). You have to call these methods to find the sum and product of two numbers. Complete the code segment as instructed.  

[Week 3: Question 5](https://github.com/Brihadeeshrk/NPTEL-JAVA/blob/master/Week_3/Program3_5.java)  Complete the code segment to swap two numbers using call by object reference.
